      "taskTitle": "Setup Header Component Structure",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of adding a SOCIAL button to the header into specific implementation steps, including HTML structure, CSS positioning, and integration with existing header components.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward UI modification task with no dependencies. It involves adding a single element to an existing structure with specific positioning requirements. The complexity is low as it's mostly markup and basic styling without complex interactions."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement SOCIAL Button Hover Animation",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific steps needed to implement a text italicization hover effect, including CSS transition properties, hover state management, and ensuring compatibility with the existing design system.",
      "reasoning": "This is a simple CSS animation task with minimal complexity. It only requires adding hover state styling with transitions to a single element. The requirements are very specific and straightforward with a clear animation pattern to follow."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Social Menu Dropdown Structure",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the dropdown menu structure into steps covering HTML structure, positioning logic, initial styling, and preparation for animation states.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a more complex UI component with multiple child elements and positioning requirements. It requires consideration of layout, structure, and preparation for future animation, but doesn't yet implement the interactive behavior."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Social Menu Animation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing staggered animations for the social menu, including defining animation keyframes, managing hover states, handling child element animations with delays, and ensuring smooth transitions.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves coordinating multiple animations with staggered timing, handling hover states across parent and child elements, and ensuring smooth interactions. The animations need to be synchronized and require precise timing control."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Add Social Media Links and Styling",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of social media links into steps covering link creation, styling to match design language, hover state implementation, and proper link configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This is a moderate complexity task focused on content implementation and styling. It involves creating and styling multiple links with hover states, but follows established patterns and doesn't require complex logic or interactions."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Mobile Touch Interaction",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps needed to adapt hover-based interactions to touch devices, including tap event handling, touch target sizing, outside-tap detection for closing, and ensuring smooth transitions on touch devices.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it requires adapting mouse-based interactions to touch devices, which introduces new event handling logic. It requires implementing tap detection, managing menu state, and ensuring proper touch target sizes for accessibility."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Menu State Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of menu state coordination into specific steps covering state tracking, event listeners for menu interactions, handling menu closing logic, and preventing conflicts between menus.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex state management between two interactive components. It requires careful coordination of states, event handling, and preventing race conditions or conflicts. The logic needs to handle multiple scenarios and edge cases."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Behavior",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing responsive behavior across breakpoints, including defining media queries, adjusting positioning and sizing rules, and testing across viewport sizes.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires adapting the component to work across multiple screen sizes. It involves creating and testing media queries, adjusting positioning and sizing, and ensuring consistent behavior across breakpoints. The complexity comes from handling various viewport scenarios."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Accessibility Features",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of accessibility features into specific steps covering keyboard navigation, ARIA attribute implementation, focus management, screen reader testing, and ensuring sufficient color contrast.",
      "reasoning": "Accessibility implementation has high complexity as it requires understanding and implementing multiple WCAG standards. It involves keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, focus management, and ensuring screen reader compatibility, each requiring specific technical knowledge."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Cross-browser Testing and Refinement",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for comprehensive cross-browser testing, including test plan creation, browser-specific issue identification, fixing compatibility issues, and final refinement of animations and interactions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves systematic testing across multiple browsers and platforms, identifying browser-specific issues, and making refinements. The complexity comes from handling various browser rendering differences and ensuring consistent behavior across environments."
