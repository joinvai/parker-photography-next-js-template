# Overview  
The "Studio" page project aims to create a new section on the Sire Design website dedicated to showcasing the design team. This page will introduce visitors to the 8 core team members through a visually consistent design that matches the existing "Watch" page. The project solves the problem of lacking team visibility on the website, is targeted at site visitors who want to learn more about the people behind Sire Design's work, and adds value by humanizing the brand and building trust with potential clients.

# Core Features  
## Team Member Profiles
- **What it does**: Displays individual profile cards for each team member with their photo, name, role, and bio
- **Why it's important**: Puts faces to the Sire Design brand and highlights the expertise behind the company
- **How it works**: Retrieves team member data from a structured `team.ts` file and renders it in a responsive grid layout

## Consistent Design System
- **What it does**: Replicates the exact layout, styling, and component behavior of the existing Watch page
- **Why it's important**: Maintains visual coherence across the website and leverages existing, proven UI patterns
- **How it works**: Reuses the same component structure, styling, and image handling techniques from the Watch page implementation

## Data Structure
- **What it does**: Establishes a maintainable data source for team member information
- **Why it's important**: Creates a single source of truth for team data that can be easily updated
- **How it works**: Defines a TypeScript interface for team member data with fields for fullName, role, bio, and mainImage

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **Website Visitors**: People interested in learning about the team behind Sire Design's services and work
- **Potential Clients**: Individuals evaluating Sire Design who want to see the expertise of team members
- **Media/Press**: Journalists or content creators looking for information about the studio team

## Key User Flows
- User navigates to the "Studio" page from site navigation
- User views the grid of team members
- User reads individual team member profiles (name, role, bio)
- User visually connects with team members through professional photos

## UI/UX Considerations
- Responsive grid layout (2 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile)
- Consistent typography and spacing matching Watch page
- Professional image presentation with optimized loading
- Visual hierarchy that emphasizes photos first, then name, role, and bio
- No specific accessibility requirements beyond standard practices

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Server Component**: `src/app/team/page.tsx` - Handles page metadata and imports data
- **Client Component**: `src/components/team/team-page-client.tsx` - Handles rendering and animations
- **Data Source**: `src/app/team/team.ts` - Contains team member information

## Data Models
```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  fullName: string;  // Name derived from image filename
  role: string;      // Initially "TBD"
  bio: string;       // Initially "TBD"
  mainImage: string; // Path to image in public/team directory
}
```

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Images must be properly placed in `public/team/` directory
- Next.js Image component to be used for optimized image loading
- Framer Motion (if used in Watch page) for animations

# Development Roadmap  
## MVP Requirements
1. Create `team.ts` data file with the TeamMember interface
2. Populate data for 8 team members with derived names and placeholder content
3. Implement server component (`page.tsx`) with proper metadata
4. Implement client component with responsive grid layout
5. Style components to exactly match Watch page design
6. Implement optimized image loading with blur placeholders

## Future Enhancements
1. Replace "TBD" placeholders with actual role and bio information
2. Add social media links for team members
3. Add sorting/filtering capabilities
4. Implement individual team member detail pages
5. Consider migrating data to a CMS or database for easier maintenance

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation**: Create the `team.ts` data structure and populate with initial data
2. **Component Structure**: Set up the server and client component files following Next.js patterns
3. **Basic Rendering**: Implement grid layout and basic team member cards
4. **Styling**: Apply all styling to match Watch page exactly
5. **Image Optimization**: Implement Next.js Image component with blur placeholders
6. **Animations**: Add any motion effects present in the Watch page

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Difficulty matching exact styling and behavior of Watch page
- **Mitigation**: Carefully analyze and reuse styling code from Watch page client component

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Image assets may not be optimized for web
- **Mitigation**: Use Next.js Image component to handle optimization automatically

## Data Maintenance
- **Risk**: Static data file may become outdated as team changes
- **Mitigation**: Design data structure for easy updates; consider future migration to CMS
