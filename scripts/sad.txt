# Solution Architecture Document: Project Detail Page Rendering Failure

**Incident Reference:** Project detail pages (`/projects/[slug]`) fail to render, displaying a blank page and logging critical "params should be awaited" errors. (Ref: RCA Report dated [Insert Date if known, otherwise omit])

**1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the technical solution to resolve the critical rendering failure observed on project detail pages (`/projects/[slug]`). The root cause, identified through Root Cause Analysis (RCA), is the non-compliant access pattern of dynamic route parameters within the Next.js Server Component (`src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`), triggering a framework-level error ("params should be awaited") *before* data fetching could occur. The proposed solution involves a targeted code modification within the page component to align with Next.js parameter handling requirements, thereby restoring page functionality. Additionally, preventative measures are outlined to enhance system resilience against similar future issues.

**2. Root Cause Summary**

The core issue is a violation of Next.js constraints regarding the handling of dynamic route parameters within `async` Server Components. Specifically, the synchronous access attempt of `params.slug` inside `ProjectPage` triggers an internal framework check error (`params should be awaited`). This error occurs *prior* to the intended call to the `getProjectById` function, halting the rendering process and preventing the necessary project data from being fetched. Consequently, the client receives an incomplete response, and the `ProjectDetailClient` component cannot render the required content (like the hero image), leading to the appearance of a blank page.

    Client Browser->>Next.js Server: GET /projects/some-slug
    Next.js Server->>ProjectPage: Instantiate with params = { slug: "some-slug" }
    Note over ProjectPage: Starts executing async function body
    Note over ProjectPage: Attempts sync access: `params.slug` for `getProjectById` call
    ProjectPage-->>ProjectPage: **ERROR THROWN HERE**: "params should be awaited" - Access violation detected by Next.js
    Note over ProjectPage: Execution halts or proceeds erroneously
    ProjectPage-->>Next.js Server: Fails to render correctly / Returns error state
    Next.js Server-->>Client Browser: Sends incomplete HTML or error indicator
    Client Browser->>ProjectDetailClient: Renders (if at all) without valid `project` prop
    Note over ProjectDetailClient: Fails to render hero image section
    Note over Client Browser: Displays default white background (`bg-white` from content div `mt-[100vh]`), appears blank. Console shows the server error.
```

**3. Proposed Solution**

The primary solution is to adjust the access pattern for the `params.slug` dynamic route parameter within the `ProjectPage` Server Component to ensure compliance with Next.js requirements.

*   **Mechanism:** The `ProjectPage` component will be modified to ensure the `slug` property is destructured directly from the `params` object (passed as props) and used immediately in the subsequent data fetching call (`getProjectById`). This direct usage pattern avoids potential intermediate steps or access methods that might trigger the framework's strict checks regarding dynamic parameter handling in `async` contexts.

**4. Technical Design Specifications**

*   **Target File:** `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`
*   **Modification Detail:** Refactor the component to explicitly destructure `slug` from the `params` prop immediately upon entry into the component function body. Use this destructured `slug` variable directly when calling `getProjectById`. Ensure the `params` prop type definition is accurate.

    ```typescript
    // src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx

    import { getProjectById } from '@/lib/projects'; // Adjust path as needed
    import ProjectDetailClient from './ProjectDetailClient'; // Adjust path as needed
    import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
    import type { Metadata, ResolvingMetadata } from 'next'; // Example for Metadata type

    // Define the expected shape of params for clarity and type safety
    interface ProjectPageProps {
      params: {
        slug: string;
      };
      // searchParams?: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }; // Include if needed
    }

    // Optional: Define Metadata generation if needed
    // export async function generateMetadata(
    //   { params }: ProjectPageProps,
    //   parent: ResolvingMetadata
    // ): Promise<Metadata> {
    //   const slug = params.slug;
    //   const project = getProjectById(slug); // Fetch data for metadata
    //   if (!project) return { title: 'Project Not Found' };
    //   return {
    //     title: project.title,
    //     description: project.description, // Or relevant field
    //   };
    // }

    // The Page Server Component
    export default async function ProjectPage({ params }: ProjectPageProps) {
      // --- Proposed Change ---
      // 1. Directly destructure 'slug' from the 'params' prop immediately.
      const { slug } = params;

      // 2. Call the data fetching function using the destructured 'slug'.
      //    (Assuming getProjectById is confirmed synchronous as per RCA)
      const project = getProjectById(slug);

      // 3. Handle the case where the project data is not found.
      if (!project) {
        notFound(); // Use Next.js notFound utility for proper 404 handling
      }

      // 4. Pass the successfully fetched data to the Client Component.
      return <ProjectDetailClient project={project} />;
    }
    ```
*   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Run the application locally (`npm run dev` or equivalent).
    2.  Navigate to several valid project detail URLs (e.g., `/projects/project-a`, `/projects/project-b`).
    3.  **Confirm:** The pages render correctly, displaying all expected content, including the main image.
    4.  **Confirm:** Check the browser's developer console and the terminal running the Next.js server; the "params should be awaited" error must be absent.
    5.  Navigate to an invalid or non-existent project slug (e.g., `/projects/invalid-slug`).
    6.  **Confirm:** The Next.js `notFound()` mechanism correctly triggers, displaying the appropriate 404 page.

**5. Integration & Deployment Plan**

*   **Integration Strategy:** The change is self-contained within the `page.tsx` file for the dynamic route. No external system integrations are affected.
*   **Testing Plan:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** (Optional but Recommended) If unit tests exist for `ProjectPage`, update them to reflect the change and verify correct data fetching calls.
    *   **Local Testing:** Perform the verification steps detailed above locally.
    *   **Staging Environment:** Deploy the code change to a staging/pre-production environment. Conduct thorough manual testing across various project pages and edge cases (invalid slugs, projects with missing optional data). Execute automated end-to-end or integration tests covering this dynamic route functionality, if available.
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Utilize the established CI/CD pipeline for deploying the validated code change to the production environment.
*   **Risk Assessment & Mitigation:**
    *   **Risk:** Low. The change directly addresses the specific error identified in the RCA and uses standard Next.js patterns. Minimal risk of unintended side effects.
    *   **Mitigation:** Perform thorough testing in staging. Monitor application performance and error logs (e.g., Sentry, Vercel Logs) closely immediately following production deployment.
*   **Rollback Procedure:** In the unlikely event of deployment failure or unforeseen critical issues in production, revert the commit containing the changes to `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` using the version control system (e.g., `git revert <commit-hash>`) and redeploy the last known stable version.

**6. Enhanced Resilience & Preventative Measures**

To bolster system robustness and prevent recurrence, the following preventative actions, aligned with the RCA recommendations, are strongly advised:

*   **Implement Loading States:** Enhance the `ProjectDetailClient` component (or leverage Next.js Suspense boundaries around it) to display a clear loading indicator while server-side data is being fetched and the component is hydrating. This improves perceived performance and user feedback.
*   **Implement Error Boundaries/Fallback UI:** Wrap `ProjectDetailClient` (or relevant sections within it) with Next.js Error Boundaries or implement conditional rendering logic to display a user-friendly error message or fallback content if the `project` prop is invalid or if a rendering error occurs, preventing the jarring blank white page.
*   **Automated Integration Testing:** Develop and integrate automated tests (e.g., using Playwright, Cypress) that specifically target dynamic project routes. These tests should verify not only page load but also the presence of key data elements, ensuring rendering integrity. Integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Strict Adherence to Next.js Documentation:** Ensure development teams consistently consult and follow the official Next.js documentation regarding best practices for Server Components, data fetching patterns (especially concerning `async`/`await`), dynamic segment handling, and parameter access. Pay close attention during Next.js version upgrades.
*   **Proactive Dependency Management:** Regularly review and update Next.js and critical related dependencies (e.g., React). Carefully examine release notes for breaking changes or updated patterns relevant to routing and data fetching.

**7. Conclusion**

The targeted modification to the `params.slug` access pattern within `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` provides a direct and effective solution to the identified rendering failure. Implementing this fix, coupled with the adoption of the recommended preventative measures for loading/error handling and testing, will restore the critical project detail page functionality and significantly improve the application's resilience and user experience.
