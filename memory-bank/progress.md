# Carousel Progress Tracker

## What Works
- Initial project setup complete
- Documentation structure established
- Requirements and goals defined
- Previous `custom-carousel` with text navigation and cursor tracking (logic confirmed, styling updated)

## What's Left to Build
1. Core Component Structure
   - [x] Basic `custom-carousel` container (Exists)
   - [x] Slide container (Exists)
   - [x] Navigation controls with "PREV" and "NEXT" text (Styling updated, logic confirmed)
   - [ ] Slide transition system for `custom-carousel` (Basic exists, needs refinement)
   - [x] **`FullScreenProjectCarousel.tsx`** created

2. Navigation System
   - [x] Text-based navigation controls for `custom-carousel` (Styling updated)
   - [ ] Touch interaction support for `custom-carousel` (Needs testing/refinement)
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation for `custom-carousel` (Needs implementation/testing)
   - [ ] Screen reader compatibility for `custom-carousel` (Basic ARIA labels added, needs testing)
   - [x] **Autoplay** functionality for `FullScreenProjectCarousel` (Implemented via plugin)

3. State Management
   - [x] Slide position tracking (Via Embla)
   - [x] Transition state management (Basic exists via Embla `isDragging` for `custom-carousel`)
   - [x] Event handling system (Exists for mouse/pointer for `custom-carousel`)
   - [ ] Touch event handling for `custom-carousel` (Needs testing/refinement)
   - [x] **Fade transition state** for `FullScreenProjectCarousel` (Implemented via JS/CSS)

4. Styling and Animation
   - [x] Responsive layout for `custom-carousel` (Basic exists)
   - [ ] Smooth transitions for `custom-carousel` (Needs implementation/refinement)
   - [x] Mobile-friendly design for `custom-carousel` (Basic flex exists)
   - [x] Hover and active states for `custom-carousel` (Basic exist for text visibility)
   - [x] **Full-screen layout** for `FullScreenProjectCarousel`
   - [x] **Fade animation** for `FullScreenProjectCarousel`

5. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Accessibility tests
   - [ ] Performance tests

## Current Status
- Phase: Initial Development
- Priority: High (for both carousels potentially)
- Timeline: TBD
- Status: In Progress

## Known Issues
1. Core Issues (`custom-carousel`)
   - ~~Broken carousel logic needs replacement~~ (Seems core logic is working as intended now)
   - Navigation system needs refinement (touch, keyboard, screen reader)

2. Technical Debt
   - Need to implement proper testing for both carousels
   - Accessibility features need thorough testing/implementation for `custom-carousel`
   - Performance optimization pending for both

3. Pending Features
   - Smooth transitions (refine for `custom-carousel`)
   - Touch support (refine for `custom-carousel`)
   - Keyboard navigation (implement for `custom-carousel`)
   - Screen reader support (refine for `custom-carousel`)

## Blockers
- None currently identified

## Next Milestones
1. Basic `custom-carousel` functionality confirmed
2. **`FullScreenProjectCarousel` component created and ready for integration** - this goes on the `src/app/page.tsx` file at the top
3. Refine transitions for `custom-carousel`
4. Implement accessibility features for `custom-carousel`
5. Testing suite for both carousels

## Recent Progress
- Set up project documentation
- Defined core requirements
- Established development structure
- Updated navigation text styling for `custom-carousel` and confirmed logic.
- **Created `FullScreenProjectCarousel` component with autoplay and fade effect.**
- Updated Memory Bank files.

## Notes
- There are now two carousel components: `custom-carousel` (manual text nav) and `FullScreenProjectCarousel` (auto-play, full-screen, fade).
- Parent component for `FullScreenProjectCarousel` needs to fetch and provide `imagePaths`.
