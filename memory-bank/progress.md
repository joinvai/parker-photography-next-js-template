# Carousel Progress Tracker

## What Works
- Initial project setup complete
- Documentation structure established
- Requirements and goals defined

## What's Left to Build
1. Core Component Structure
   - [x] Basic carousel container (Exists)
   - [x] Slide container (Exists)
   - [x] Navigation controls with "PREV" and "NEXT" text (Styling updated, logic confirmed)
   - [ ] Slide transition system (Basic exists, needs refinement)

2. Navigation System
   - [x] Text-based navigation controls (Styling updated)
   - [ ] Touch interaction support (Needs testing/refinement)
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation (Needs implementation/testing)
   - [ ] Screen reader compatibility (Basic ARIA labels added, needs testing)

3. State Management
   - [x] Slide position tracking (Via Embla)
   - [x] Transition state management (Basic exists via Embla `isDragging`)
   - [x] Event handling system (Exists for mouse/pointer)
   - [ ] Touch event handling (Needs testing/refinement)

4. Styling and Animation
   - [x] Responsive layout (Basic exists)
   - [ ] Smooth transitions (Needs implementation/refinement)
   - [x] Mobile-friendly design (Basic flex exists)
   - [x] Hover and active states (Basic exist for text visibility)

5. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Accessibility tests
   - [ ] Performance tests

## Current Status
- Phase: Initial Development
- Priority: High
- Timeline: TBD
- Status: In Progress

## Known Issues
1. Core Issues
   - Broken carousel logic needs replacement
   - Navigation system requires rebuild
   - No state management implementation

2. Technical Debt
   - Need to implement proper testing
   - Accessibility features not yet implemented
   - Performance optimization pending

3. Pending Features
   - Smooth transitions
   - Touch support
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support

## Blockers
- None currently identified

## Next Milestones
1. Basic carousel functionality
2. Text-based navigation implementation
3. Smooth transitions
4. Accessibility features
5. Testing suite

## Recent Progress
- Set up project documentation
- Defined core requirements
- Established development structure
- Updated navigation text styling to "PREV"/"NEXT" and removed blend mode effect. Confirmed core cursor-following logic is intended behavior.

## Notes
- Navigation text styling is finalized.
- Core logic confirmed (cursor follow, hover trigger).
- Next steps involve refining transitions and addressing accessibility more deeply (keyboard nav, screen reader experience).
