# Progress Report

## What Works
- Basic carousel implementation with shadcn
- Three images displayed simultaneously
- Full-width layout
- Image loading and responsive sizing
- Cursor-following hover text implementation
- PP Editorial font integration

## What's Left to Build
1. Fix navigation hover text bug:
   - Current implementation uses array indices which breaks during scrolling
   - Need to implement position-based hover text that stays accurate while scrolling

## Current Status
- MVP implemented but needs bug fixes
- Core functionality working but navigation UX needs improvement

## Known Issues
1. Navigation Hover Text Bug:
   - Description: Hover text position is tied to array indices instead of visible position
   - Impact: PREV/NEXT indicators appear on wrong images after scrolling
   - Root Cause: Using array index logic instead of tracking visible slide positions
   - Priority: High

## Next Milestone
- Implement proper hover text positioning using Embla Carousel's API
- Ensure consistent behavior during and after scrolling

## Technical Debt
- Current hover logic is tightly coupled to array indices
- Need to refactor to use carousel's API for slide position tracking

## Evolution of Decisions
1. Initial Implementation:
   - Used basic index-based hover logic
   - Discovered limitations during scrolling
2. Current State:
   - Need to refactor to position-based approach
   - Will require deeper integration with carousel API
