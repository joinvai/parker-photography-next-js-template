# Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- Phase: Initial Development
- Stage: Component Implementation
- Priority: High

## What Works
- Initial project setup complete
- Documentation structure established
- Requirements fully defined
- Technical specifications documented
- Header component implemented with:
  - Hamburger menu animation
  - Full-screen overlay
  - Numbered navigation
  - Sequential animations
  - Accessibility features
  - Dynamic logo switching
    - Black logo for default state
    - White logo for open menu state
    - Configurable via props
