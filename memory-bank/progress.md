# Progress

## What Works
- ✓ Font files are properly placed in public/fonts directory
- ✓ Local font loading configured in layout.tsx with correct relative paths (based on tsconfig.json)
- ✓ Tailwind configuration updated with new font families
- ✓ Global CSS updated to apply fonts consistently

## What's Left to Build
- Test font rendering across different components
- Verify font loading performance
- Check font fallback behavior

## Current Status
Font system implementation is complete and ready for testing. The system uses:
- DM Sans for body text (Regular, Medium, Bold)
- Editorial New for headings (Regular, Ultrabold)

## Known Issues
- ✓ Fixed: Font file paths were incorrect in layout.tsx
- ✓ Fixed: Editorial New font files were referenced with wrong extension (.ttf instead of .otf)
- ✓ Fixed: Updated paths to use correct relative path from src/app/layout.tsx

## Recent Changes
1. Updated layout.tsx to use correct relative paths (../../public/fonts/...)
2. Fixed Editorial New font file references to use .otf extension
3. Modified Tailwind config with new font families
4. Added base layer styles in globals.css
5. Documented font system in memory bank
