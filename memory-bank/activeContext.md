# Carousel Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing text-based navigation controls ("PREV" and "NEXT")
- Fixing broken carousel logic
- Setting up initial component structure

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup
- Documentation structure established
- Core requirements defined
- Updated carousel navigation text styling ("PREV"/"NEXT", removed blend mode)

## Next Steps
1. Review existing carousel logic for any remaining issues
2. Verify state management (seems okay based on code review)
3. Implement smooth transition animations
4. Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels exist, check keyboard/focus)

## Active Decisions
1. Using text-based navigation instead of arrows
2. Implementing as a controlled React component
3. Following mobile-first approach
4. Prioritizing accessibility

## Current Considerations
1. Transition animation smoothness
2. Mobile touch interaction
3. Keyboard navigation implementation
4. Screen reader compatibility

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Basic component structure (exists)
- [x] Text-based navigation controls (styling updated, logic confirmed)
- [ ] Slide transition logic (basic Embla transitions exist, need refinement?)
- [x] Responsive design (basic flex layout exists)
- [ ] Accessibility features (ARIA labels added, needs more testing)
- [ ] Testing suite

## Known Issues
1. Current carousel logic is broken and needs replacement
2. Navigation system needs complete rebuild
3. No proper state management implemented yet

## Today's Focus
1. Confirm carousel logic is working as intended after styling change.
2. Plan next steps for transition refinements and accessibility.

## Notes
- Styling for navigation text ("PREV"/"NEXT") is now finalized.
- Core logic (cursor follow, hover trigger on first/last slide) confirmed as intended.
- Next focus: Transitions and deeper accessibility checks.
