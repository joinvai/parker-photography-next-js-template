# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementation of the interactive header component with the following features:
1. ✓ Hamburger menu with animation
2. ✓ Full-screen overlay navigation
3. ✓ Numbered navigation links
4. ✓ Sequential fade-in animations

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup
- Documentation creation
- Requirements gathering
- Technical specification
- Implemented header component with Framer Motion
- Added accessibility features
- Configured animation timings per brief

## Active Decisions

### Animation Implementation
Decision made: Implemented using Framer Motion
- Pros: More powerful animation control, easier sequencing
- Implementation Status: Complete
  - Hamburger animation (300ms)
  - Overlay fade (400ms)
  - Sequential navigation items (100ms stagger)
  - Total animation sequence under 1000ms

### Component Structure
Implemented using:
1. ✓ Single container with subcomponents
   - Header container with hamburger and logo
   - Overlay with navigation menu
   - Modular animation variants

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. [x] Set up basic component structure
2. [x] Implement hamburger menu animation
3. [x] Create overlay transition
4. [x] Add navigation links with numbers
5. [x] Implement sequential animations

### Upcoming Work
1. [ ] Verify performance metrics
   - Animation frame rate (60fps target)
   - Load time impact
   - Interaction response time
2. [ ] Cross-browser testing
3. [ ] Documentation updates

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. Need to verify animation performance across devices
2. Ensure consistent behavior across browsers
3. Validate accessibility implementation

### Open Questions
1. ✓ Animation library selection (Resolved: Using Framer Motion)
2. Performance optimization opportunities
3. Browser compatibility verification needed

## Development Status
- Phase: Implementation Complete
- Priority: High
- Timeline: Moving to Testing Phase
