# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementation of the interactive header component with the following key features:
1. Hamburger menu with animation
2. Full-screen overlay navigation
3. Numbered navigation links
4. Sequential fade-in animations

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup
- Documentation creation
- Requirements gathering
- Technical specification

## Active Decisions

### Animation Implementation
Currently evaluating two approaches:
1. **Framer Motion**
   - Pros: More powerful animation control, easier sequencing
   - Cons: Additional bundle size, learning curve

2. **Tailwind v3**
   - Pros: Already in toolchain, lighter weight
   - Cons: More manual animation coordination needed

### Component Structure
Deciding between:
1. Single container with subcomponents
2. Compound component pattern
3. Hooks-based animation management

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. [ ] Set up basic component structure
2. [ ] Implement hamburger menu animation
3. [ ] Create overlay transition
4. [ ] Add navigation links with numbers
5. [ ] Implement sequential animations

### Upcoming Work
1. [ ] Accessibility implementation
2. [ ] Performance optimization
3. [ ] Cross-browser testing
4. [ ] Documentation updates

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. Ensuring smooth animations across devices
2. Managing animation sequence timing
3. Handling edge cases in navigation

### Open Questions
1. Animation library final selection
2. Performance optimization strategy
3. Mobile interaction patterns

## Development Status
- Phase: Initial Implementation
- Priority: High
- Timeline: Active Development
