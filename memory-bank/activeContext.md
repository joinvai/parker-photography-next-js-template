# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Image Carousel Enhancement
1. **Core Implementation**
   - ✅ Integrated Embla Carousel API for accurate position tracking
   - ✅ Implemented smooth looping with duplicated images
   - ✅ Added proper hover text positioning based on visible slides
   - ✅ Implemented drag state tracking

2. **Responsive Design**
   - ✅ Desktop: Three images visible
   - ✅ Mobile: Full-width slides with flex basis
   - ✅ Smooth transitions between breakpoints

3. **User Interaction**
   - ✅ Hover text follows cursor
   - ✅ "prev" text on first visible slide
   - ✅ "next" text on last visible slide
   - ✅ Proper handling of drag interactions

## Recent Changes

### 1. Carousel Architecture
- Switched to direct Embla Carousel implementation
- Removed shadcn/ui carousel components
- Added proper event handling for pointer interactions
- Implemented smooth looping with duplicated images

### 2. Position Tracking
- Using Embla's `slidesInView()` API for accurate slide tracking
- Implemented proper hover text positioning
- Added drag state management
- Fixed edge cases with scroll position

### 3. Responsive Implementation
- Using CSS flex basis for responsive layouts
- Maintaining aspect ratio for images
- Smooth transitions between viewport sizes
- Proper image loading priorities

## Next Steps

### 1. High Priority
- [ ] Test edge cases with rapid scrolling
- [ ] Verify mobile touch interactions
- [ ] Ensure smooth performance with image loading
- [ ] Add error boundaries for image loading failures

### 2. Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize image loading strategy
- [ ] Add loading states for images
- [ ] Enhance accessibility features
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support

### 3. Low Priority
- [ ] Add optional autoplay feature
- [ ] Implement progress indicators
- [ ] Add transition animations
- [ ] Enhance error handling

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. Technical Decisions
- Using Embla Carousel for reliable position tracking
- Duplicating images for smooth infinite loop
- Using pointer events for drag state management
- Implementing responsive design through CSS

### 2. UX Decisions
- Cursor-following hover text
- Immediate feedback on drag start
- Smooth transitions for hover states
- Clear navigation indicators

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Image loading optimization
- Smooth scrolling behavior
- Efficient state management
- Event listener cleanup

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### 1. Component Structure
```typescript
// Main component structure
export default function ImageCarousel() {
    // Embla carousel setup
    const [emblaRef, emblaApi] = useEmblaCarousel({...})
    
    // State management
    const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({...})
    const [hoveredImage, setHoveredImage] = useState(null)
    
    // Event handlers
    useEffect(() => {
        // Mouse movement tracking
        // Carousel event listeners
    }, [])
    
    // Render logic
    return (
        <div ref={emblaRef}>
            {/* Carousel content */}
        </div>
    )
}
```

### 2. Event Handling Pattern
```typescript
// Event setup pattern
useEffect(() => {
    if (!emblaApi) return;
    
    const handlers = {
        select: () => {...},
        pointerDown: () => {...},
        pointerUp: () => {...}
    };
    
    // Attach handlers
    Object.entries(handlers).forEach(([event, handler]) => {
        emblaApi.on(event, handler);
    });
    
    // Cleanup
    return () => {
        Object.entries(handlers).forEach(([event, handler]) => {
            emblaApi.off(event, handler);
        });
    };
}, [emblaApi]);
```

## Learnings & Project Insights

### 1. Technical Insights
- Embla Carousel provides better control than shadcn/ui components
- Position tracking needs both visible slides and scroll state
- Event cleanup is crucial for preventing memory leaks
- Image duplication helps with smooth infinite scrolling

### 2. UX Insights
- Immediate feedback on interactions improves user experience
- Cursor-following text provides intuitive navigation
- Drag state management prevents conflicting interactions
- Responsive design needs careful breakpoint handling

### 3. Performance Insights
- Image loading strategy affects scroll performance
- State updates need to be optimized for smooth animations
- Event listener management is crucial for performance
- CSS-based responsive design is more efficient than JS

This document reflects the current state of the carousel enhancement project and guides immediate actions. It should be updated as progress is made and new insights are gained.
