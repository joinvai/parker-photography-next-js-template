# Product Requirements Document: Interactive Navigation Header Component

## 1. Overview

### Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for developing a reusable header component featuring an interactive hamburger menu, animated transitions, and a responsive navigation system. The header will serve as the primary navigation interface across the application, providing users with an engaging and intuitive way to access key sections of the website.

### Scope
The scope encompasses the development of a fully functional, animated header component using either Framer Motion or Tailwind v3, including all interactive elements, animations, and responsive behaviors.

## 2. Product features

1. Hamburger Menu Icon
   - Located in top-left corner
   - Transforms into 'X' when activated
   - Smooth rotation animation during state change

2. Logo Section
   - Placeholder "ACME" knockout logo
   - Centered placement
   - High visibility and clear contrast

3. Navigation Menu
   - Four primary navigation links
   - Numbered indicators above each link
   - Sequential fade-in animation
   - Full-screen overlay with black background when active

### Navigation structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Links are clearly visible against the black overlay
- Hover state provides visual feedback
- Links are properly spaced for touch interfaces
- Click/tap triggers appropriate navigation
- Menu closes after link selection
