 update our header so that we can pass in a logo as a prop based on what type of page it's on. We have black and white PNG logos attached and we'll need to have the ability to select which one to use. When the menu that is full screen on the header is open, we'll always use the white at two x dot PNG and most of the time we use the black at two x PNG for the non open state.
