We need to make a full screen width and screen height image carousel that rotates through all the images in the `/public/projects/` directory. 

The imges should be 1 at a time, and the carousel should be horizontal. 

The carousel should be animated and smooth. 

The carousel should have no padding on the left or right. It needs to be flush with the edges of the screen. 

The carousel should not have navigation dots. 

The carousel will automatically advance to the next image every 5 seconds with a smooth, high fidelity fade in and fade out. 

The carousel should be responsive and work on all screen sizes.

The new carousel will be called `full-screen-carousel.tsx` and will be in the `src/components` directory. We use it at the top of the `src/app/page.tsx` file.
