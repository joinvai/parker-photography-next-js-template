theres a bug in our expected behavior. we should have the word PREV show up when hovering over the left card and the word NEXT show up when hovering over the right card.


right now when u hover on the left card it shows a cursor switching between hover and click state and no words appear.



It seems to get out of whack when we scroll the carousel. Perhaps we do it by the width of the container in 1st and 3rd visible slides?
