 we need to update the fonts across our project and globals and have them as a variable. So yeah, and layout.tsx, we have them local, so we use next local I believe. And then we need to make tailwind.config.ts changes and the globals.css changes. 

 @public/fonts/DM SANS for the body font 
 @public/fonts/Editorial New for the heading font 


@app/layout.tsx
@app/globals.css
tailwind.config.ts
