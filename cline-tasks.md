# Incident Remediation Tasks: Project Detail Page Rendering Failure

Based on Solution Architecture Document: Project Detail Page Rendering Failure

## Phase 1: Immediate Fix Implementation

- [x] **Modify `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`:**
    - [x] Define `ProjectPageProps` interface for type safety.
    - [x] Update `ProjectPage` function signature to use `ProjectPageProps`.
    - [x] Destructure `slug` directly from `params` prop.
    - [x] Call `getProjectById(slug)` using the destructured variable.
    - [x] Implement `notFound()` check if `project` is null/undefined.
    - [x] Pass the fetched `project` data to `<ProjectDetailClient />`.
- [ ] **Verify Fix Locally:**
    - [ ] Run `npm run dev`.
    - [ ] Check valid project URLs (e.g., `/projects/project-a`). Confirm rendering and absence of "params awaited" error in console/terminal.
    - [ ] Check invalid project URL (e.g., `/projects/invalid-slug`). Confirm 404 page is shown.
- [ ] **Test Fix in Staging:**
    - [ ] Deploy changes to staging environment.
    - [ ] Perform manual testing across various project pages and edge cases.
    - [ ] Execute automated tests (if available).
- [ ] **Deploy Fix to Production:**
    - [ ] Merge validated changes.
    - [ ] Use CI/CD pipeline for deployment.
- [ ] **Monitor Production:**
    - [ ] Closely monitor application performance and error logs post-deployment.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Resilience & Preventative Measures

- [ ] **Implement Loading States:** Enhance `ProjectDetailClient` or use Suspense boundaries for loading indicators.
- [ ] **Implement Error Boundaries/Fallback UI:** Wrap `ProjectDetailClient` or implement conditional rendering for error handling.
- [ ] **Automated Integration Testing:** Develop/integrate tests targeting dynamic project routes into CI/CD.
- [ ] **Review Next.js Best Practices:** Ensure team adherence to official documentation, especially for async components and data fetching.
- [ ] **Proactive Dependency Management:** Regularly review and update Next.js and related dependencies.
