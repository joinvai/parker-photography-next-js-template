# Project Image Grid with Hover Effect PRD

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a responsive image grid feature that displays project images in an alternating column layout with hover functionality to reveal secondary images.

## Problem statement
Currently, there is a need to showcase project images in an organized, visually appealing grid that provides additional context through hover interactions. The grid needs to maintain a specific layout pattern while being responsive and performant.

## Technical requirements

### Grid layout specification
- Layout pattern repeats in the following sequence:
  1. Two columns (2 images)
  2. One column (1 image)
  3. Two columns (2 images)
  4. One column (1 image)
- Total of 17 images to be displayed
- Pattern repeats until all images are displayed

### Image requirements
- Each project must provide:
  1. Primary image (displayed by default)
  2. Secondary image (displayed on hover)
- Images should maintain aspect ratio
- Images should load lazily for performance
- Images should be optimized for web delivery

### Interaction specifications
- Hover effect:
  - Trigger: Mouse hover over image container
  - Action: Smoothly transition from primary to secondary image
  - Transition: 300ms ease-in-out
- Mobile considerations:
  - Touch interaction should trigger image swap
  - Touch again to revert to primary image

## User stories

### US-001: View project grid
**As a** website visitor  
**I want to** see a grid of project images  
**So that** I can browse through Sire Design's portfolio

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Grid displays in the specified 2-1-2-1 column pattern
- Images are properly sized and maintain aspect ratio
- Grid is responsive across different screen sizes
- Images load lazily as user scrolls

### US-002: Image hover interaction
**As a** website visitor  
**I want to** hover over project images  
**So that** I can see alternative views of each project

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Secondary image appears on hover
- Transition between images is smooth
- Original image returns when hover ends
- Touch devices support tap to toggle between images

### US-003: Grid navigation
**As a** website visitor  
**I want to** easily scan through all projects  
**So that** I can quickly browse the portfolio

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Grid maintains consistent spacing between items
- Layout is predictable and rhythmic
- Scrolling is smooth and performant
- Grid maintains integrity across screen sizes

## Technical implementation

### Data structure
```typescript
interface ProjectImage {
  id: string;
  primaryImage: {
    src: string;
    alt: string;
  };
  secondaryImage: {
    src: string;
    alt: string;
  };
}
```

### Component structure
```typescript
interface ImageGridProps {
  projects: ProjectImage[];
}

interface ImageItemProps {
  project: ProjectImage;
  layout: 'full' | 'half'; // for column width
}
```

### Layout algorithm
1. Calculate number of rows needed based on pattern repeat
2. Distribute 17 images across pattern
3. Apply appropriate width classes based on position in pattern

## Performance requirements
- Images must be optimized and compressed
- Lazy loading must be implemented
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) under 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) under 0.1

## Testing requirements
- Unit tests for component logic
- Visual regression tests for layout
- Performance testing for image loading
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing
- Accessibility testing

## Success metrics
- Grid loads within performance requirements
- No layout shifts during image loading
- Smooth transitions on hover/touch
- Maintains visual integrity across breakpoints

## Dependencies
- Next.js Image component
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Intersection Observer API for lazy loading
- Touch events API for mobile interaction

## Timeline
- Development: 3-4 days
- Testing: 2 days
- QA and refinement: 1 day
- Total: 6-7 days

## Risks and mitigations
1. **Risk**: Large images impacting performance
   **Mitigation**: Implement aggressive image optimization and caching

2. **Risk**: Layout shifts during image loading
   **Mitigation**: Use aspect ratio boxes and image placeholders

3. **Risk**: Mobile performance issues
   **Mitigation**: Implement progressive enhancement and optimize for mobile first

## Future considerations
- Addition of filtering capabilities
- Animation enhancements
- Integration with CMS for dynamic content
- Analytics tracking for interaction patterns
